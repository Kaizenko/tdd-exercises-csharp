This repository is a starter project for our exercises.

You will need an IDE like [Visual Studio](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/) or [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) and .NET Core 3+.

Once your IDE is setup,
1. Clone the repo
2. Open the GettingStartedTests class
3. Run Tests
4. You should get 1 failing test with the message: "You are all set!"

That's it. We are now ready to work on the exercises together.
